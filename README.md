Main tasks for the project:

- Connect the Little Lemon restaurant back-end to MySQL
- Set up a Little Lemon restaurant booking API
- Insert booking data in the database via the booking API

## API URL

Localhost base URL is http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Getting Started

### Installation and Database Setup

Clone the repo by running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarinaSaitgareeva/META-Back-End-Capstone-Little-Lemon
```

#### Installing Dependencies

- [Python 3.11.0](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python).
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
- [Djoser](https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) provides a set of Django Rest Framework views to handle basic actions such as registration, login, logout, password reset and account activation.
- [PyMySQL](https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/#documentation) is MySQL connector for Python (contains a pure-Python MySQL client library, based on PEP 249, it's compatible with mysqlclient and MySQLdb).
  or [mysqlclient](https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/) is MySQL connector for Python (this project is a fork of MySQLdb1).

#### Virtual Environment

It is recommended to work within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [venv docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Create the virtual environment for the project directory

```bash
python3 -m venv <name>
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source <name>/bin/activate
```

Deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

Delete the virtual environment:

```bash
rm -r <name>
```

#### Installing Python Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the project directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages in the `requirements.txt` file.

---

## Database Setup

The project uses **MySQL** database.

Change settings (USER and PASSWORD) in littlelemon/settings.py, you should use your credentials.

DATABASES = {
"default": {
...
"USER" : "admindjango",
"PASSWORD" : "employee@123!",
...
}

Generate database tables from the models:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

## Running the Server

Switch to the project directory and ensure that the virtual environment is running.

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

---

## Testing

Run tests:

```bash
python3 manage.py test
```

In `notes.txt` you can find credentials for admin and customer.

You can use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test endpoints. In order for them to work properly, update the Bearer Tokens in each collection with tokens generated from the website. See the `notes.txt`.

---

## API

In order to use the API, users need to be authenticated. JWT tokens can be generated by logging in with the provided credentials (username and password) on the hosted site.

POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/token/login/

### Endpoints

- Note: any `curl` commands used must include an authorization header as all endpoints require authorization to use:  
  `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN>"`
- For post and patch you need you need also add Content-Type:
  `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{data}"`
